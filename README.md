# Decision Tree

`dt.py` is the python implementation of decision tree
`dt.ipynb` is the decision tree demo in ipython notebook

## Introduction
The Algorithm used to construct decision tree has complexity of O(n^2) since the dataset is small and `numpy` implementation optimized in O(n^2) algorithm.
